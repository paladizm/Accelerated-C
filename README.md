C++ used to be my language of choice back in college, but after a taste of dynamic languages I have gotten rusty. This repo
will be used to knock ome of the rust off and see whats new in the world o C++ maybe even some C++11 we will see where the
wind takes me. I have a good amount of side projects already, but I hope to make time for this as well.

Feel free to use my examples for whatever.
